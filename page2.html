        <h1>How are Dragons Viewed in Mythology</h1>
        <h2>In African Mythology</h2>
        <p> In African mythology, dragons are often depicted as powerful and mystical creatures closely intertwined with spiritual beliefs and folklore. Across various African cultures, dragons may take on different forms and names, but they commonly symbolize aspects of nature, such as rain, fertility, or guardianship. In some traditions, dragons are revered as protectors of the land or as manifestations of ancestral spirits, embodying both benevolent and fearsome qualities.</p>
        <h2>In European Mythology</h2>
        <p> European mythology portrays dragons as formidable and often malevolent creatures, embodying chaos and destruction. These dragons typically possess sharp claws, powerful wings, and the ability to breathe fire. They are commonly depicted as antagonists in heroic tales, where brave knights embark on quests to slay the dragon and restore order to the realm. Dragons in European folklore symbolize greed, tyranny, and the eternal struggle between good and evil.</p>
        <h2>In Asian Mythology</h2>
        <p> In Asian mythology, particularly in Chinese and Japanese culture, dragons hold a revered and auspicious status. Far from being malevolent, these dragons are seen as benevolent and wise beings, associated with auspicious qualities such as strength, wisdom, and good fortune. In Chinese mythology, dragons are celestial creatures capable of controlling the elements and are often depicted as benevolent rulers of water and weather. Japanese mythology similarly portrays dragons as powerful and benevolent beings, often associated with the sea and revered as guardians of the land.</p>
